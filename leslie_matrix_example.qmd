## Leslie Matrix example

We are going to model population changes using the same example as in lecture.

```{r}

insect_leslie <- matrix(c(0, 0, 600, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0.08, 0), 
                        nrow= 3, 
                        ncol = 3, 
                        byrow= TRUE)

insect_leslie
```

We made the matrix! Now we will give this matrix an initial condition to run some calculations.

```{r}

#initial condition of 12000 eggs, 700 larvae and 500 females

insect_yr0 <- c(12000, 700, 500)   #this is a vector
```

```{r}
insect_yr1 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_yr0

insect_yr1
```

Estimate populations at each life stage at year 2 and year 3

```{r}
#year 2 
insect_yr2 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_yr1

insect_yr2
```

```{r}
insect_yr3 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_yr2

insect_yr3
```
